The Draco software suite links against external libraries. Copyrights to these
associated software packages may are listed below:

1. Various MPI implementations (OpenMPI, MPICH, Microsoft MPI, Intel MPI, etc.);
   https://www.open-mpi.org/community/license.php

   An open source Message Passing Interface implementation. The Open MPI Project
   is an open source Message Passing Interface implementation that is developed
   and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry
   partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies,
   and resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in
   order to build the best MPI library available.  Open MPI offers advantages
   for system and software vendors, application developers and computer science
   researchers.

2. Gnu Scientific Library - GSL is distributed under the terms of the GNU
   General Public License (GPL) - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

   The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++
   programmers. It is free software under the GNU General Public License.  The
   library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number
   generators, special functions and least-squares fitting.  There are over 1000
   functions in total with an extensive test suite.

3. LAPACK - http://www.netlib.org/lapack/LICENSE.txt  (or equivalent)

   LAPACK version 3.X is a comprehensive FORTRAN library that does linear
   algebra operations including matrix inversions, least squared solutions to
   linear sets of equations, eigenvector analysis, singular value decomposition,
   etc. It is a very comprehensive and reputable package that has found
   extensive use in the scientific community.

4. Random123 -
   https://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_random123.cgi/Random123_License.txt

   Random123 is a library of 'counter-based' random number generators (CBRNGs),
   in which the Nth random number can be obtained by applying a stateless mixing
   function to N instead of the conventional approach of using N iterations of a
   stateful transformation.

7. Metis - http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview

   METIS is a set of serial programs for partitioning graphs, partitioning
   finite element meshes, and producing fill reducing orderings for sparse
   matrices. The algorithms implemented in METIS are based on the multilevel
   recursive-bisection, multilevel k-way, and multi-constraint partitioning
   schemes.

8. ParMetis - http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview

   ParMETIS is an MPI-based parallel library that implements a variety of
   algorithms for partitioning unstructured graphs, meshes, and for computing
   fill-reducing orderings of sparse matrices.

9. SuperLU-DIST - http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/

   A general purpose library for the direct solution of large, sparse,
   nonsymmetric systems of linear equations on high performance machines.
