 * \class Homogeneous_New
 * \brief Allocator for large number of individual objects of identical size
 *
 * This class optimizes allocation of memory under the following
 * circumstances:
 *
 * <ol><li>Memory is allocated or deallocated for one object at a time.</li>
 * <li>The objects are all identical in size.</li>
 * <li>Large numbers of these objects will be allocated and deallocated in an
 * inpredictable manner.</li></ol>
 *
 * This class does not support memory requests of any size other than the
 * object size specified at construction. However, requests of the correct
 * size are handled more efficiently than is possible for the C++ library
 * default allocator, or for any other allocator that handles requests of
 * arbitrary size.
 *
 * Note that this class is \em not suitable for implementing STL allocator
 * classes, which is why we call it \c Homogeneous_New rather than \c
 * Homogeneous_Allocator.  STL allocators generally must be able to support
 * memory requests of varying size and have other requirements that cannot be
 * supported well by this class.
 *
 * The implementation of this class is a linked list of blocks of memory whose
 * size should be tuned to minimize memory fragmentation without wasting
 * excessive memory in the last, partially filled, block in the list.  Each
 * block is itself divided into segments of the anticipated object size, and
 * all unused segments from all the memory blocks are organized into their own
 * linked list.
 *
 * When a memory request is received, the address of the first free segment is
 * returned and the next free segment is moved to the top of the list.  When a
 * memory release is received, the returned memory segment is placed at the
 * top of the list.  These are fast operations unless all segments are in use
 * and a new memory block must be allocated.  Memory segments currently in use
 * are not part of the segment list and need no extraneous storage for
 * management.  The only extraneous storage is that required for the linked
 * list of contiguous memory blocks in which the segments live.  Even this
 * extraneous storage could be eliminated if we did not care about destruction
 * of the allocator itself.
 *
 * Unlike the memory segments, the memory blocks from which the segments are
 * drawn need not be identical in size (though this is the default behavior.)
 * A user may at any time call the \c reserve function to indicate that a
 * number of objects are about to be allocated.  If the required number of
 * segments are not available to fill the anticipated requests, a new memory
 * block will be allocated that is at least large enough to accomodate all the
 * anticipated requests.  If the user anticipates that the maximum number of
 * allocations will never exceed \c N, he should call <code> reserve(N)
 * </code> immediately after constructing the allocator.
 *
 * Example: A finite element code allocates cell objects one at a time off the
 * heap, because each cell type is represented by its own class (descended
 * from a common type.)  There will likely be large numbers of each cell
 * type. The initial number of cells of each type is known, and the user
 * anticipates that mesh refinement and load balancing will not change these
 * numbers by more than about 20%. \c Homogeneous_New should then be ideal for
 * implementing an <code> operator new </code> for each cell type.  The
 * allocators should initially \c reserve 1.2 times the number of cells of
 * each type.
 *
 * The concepts underlying this class are from a paper by Andy Koenig
 * presented at a USENIX meeting in the early 1990s.
