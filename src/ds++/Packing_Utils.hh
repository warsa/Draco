 * \class Packer
 *
 * \brief Pack data into a byte stream.
 *
 * This class allows clients to \em "register" a \c char* stream and then load
 * it with data of any type.  This assumes that the \c sizeof(T) operator works
 * and has meaning for the type.  Under the hood it uses \c std::memcpy to
 * perform the loading.  This class is easily understood by checking the
 * examples.
 *
 * No memory allocation is performed by the Packer.  However, the memory
 * requirements may be computed by putting the Packer into
 * \c compute_buffer_size_mode().
 *
 * The benefit of using the Packer class is that byte copies are isolated into
 * this one section of code, thus obviating the need for reinterpret_cast
 * statements in client code.  In fact, this functionality conforms exactly to
 * the ANSI C++ standard for copying byte-streams of data
 * (sec. 3.9). Additionally, bounds checking is performed on all stream packing
 * operations.  This bounds checking is always on.
 *
 * This class returns real char * pointers through its query functions.  We do
 * not use the STL iterator notation, even though that is how the pointers are
 * used, so as not to confuse the fact that these char * streams are \e
 * continuous \e data byte-streams.  The pointers that are used to "iterate"
 * through the streams are real pointers, not an abstract iterator class.  So
 * one could think of these as iterators (they act like iterators) but they are
 * real pointers into a continguous memory \c char* stream.
 *
 * Data can be unpacked using the Unpacker class.

 * \brief Set an allocated buffer to write data into.
 *
 * If \c compute_buffer_size_mode() is on, this function turns it off.
 *
 * This function accepts an allocated \c char* buffer.  It assigns begin and end
 * pointers and a mutable position pointer that acts like an iterator.  The
 * Packer will write POD (Plain Old Data) data into this buffer starting at the
 * beginning address of the buffer.  This function must be called before any \c
 * Packer::pack calls can be made.
 *
 * Once \c Packer::set_buffer is called, all subsequent calls to \c Packer::pack
 * will write data incrementally into the buffer set by set_buffer.  To write
 * data into a different buffer, call \c Packer::set_buffer again; at this point
 * the Packer no longer has any knowledge about the old buffer.
 *
 * Note, the buffer must be allocated large enough to hold all the data that the
 * client intends to load into it.  There is no memory allocation performed by
 * the Packer class; thus, the buffer cannot be increased in size if a value is
 * written past the end of the buffer.  Optionally, the required buffer size may
 * also be computed using the \c compute_buffer_size_mode().  See the \c
 * Packer::pack function for more details.

 * \param size_in size of the buffer

/*!
 * \brief Depending on mode, pack data into a buffer, or compute increment
 * to buffer size.
 *
 * This function's behavior depends on whether in compute_buffer_size_mode(), or
 * not.
 *
 * In compute_buffer_size_mode(), the sizeof(T) operator is used to add the size
 * of the data to the total stream size.  Once this function is called for all
 * of the data to be packed, the size() member function may be used to retrieve
 * the buffer size required.
 *
 * Note that using compute_buffer_size_mode() is optional.  See examples below.
 *
 * Regardless, once the user allocates the buffer, set_buffer() may then be
 * called, which turns off compute_buffer_size_mode (if on).  A call to pack()
 * then actually packs its argument into the buffer.  It also advances the
 * pointer (iterator) location to the next location automatically.  It uses the
 * sizeof(T) operator to get the size of the data; thus, only data where
 * sizeof() has meaning will be properly written to the buffer.
 *
 * Packer::pack() does bounds checking to ensure that the buffer and buffer size
 * defined by Packer::set_buffer are consistent.  This bounds-checking is always
 * on as the Packer is not normally used in compute-intensive calculations.
 *
 * \param value data of type T to pack into the buffer; the data size must be
 *              accessible using the sizeof() operator.
 *
 * Example using compute_buffer_size_mode():
 \code
 double d1 = 5.0, d2 = 10.3;         // data to be packed
 Packer p;
 p.compute_buffer_size_mode();
 p << d1 << d2;                      // computes required size
 vector<char> buffer(p.size());      // allocate buffer
 p.set_buffer(p.size(), &buffer[0]);
 p << d1 << d2;                      // packs d1 and d2 into buffer
 \endcode
 *
 * Example not using compute_buffer_size_mode():
 \code
 double d1 = 5.0, d2 = 10.3;
 Packer p;
 uint64_t bsize = 2 * sizeof(double);  // compute buffer size
 vector<char> buffer(bsize);
 p.set_buffer(bsize, &buffer[0]);
 p << d1 << d2;                            // packs d1 and d2 into buffer

 * \arg FT::const_iterator const iterator for the field
 * \arg FT::size() returns the number of elements in the field
 * \arg FT::begin() returns an iterator to the beginning of the field
 * \arg FT::end() returns an iterator to the end of the field
 * \arg FT::empty() determines if a container is empty
 *
 * Given these contraints, the function cannot be used to pack up a pointer
 * array; however, this is accomplished easily enough with the Packer class
 * alone.
 *
 * The data in the field is packed into a \c vector<char>. The \c vector<char>
 * passed to the function must be empty; an assertion is thrown if it is not.
 * We do this for usage protection; we want the user to be aware that data in
 * the \c vector<char> would be destroyed.

 * In summary, this is a simple function that is a shortcut for using the Packer
