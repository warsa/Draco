\page overview_cdi_ipcress Overview of the cdi_ipcress package
\version Draco-@Draco_VERSION@
\author Kelly Thompson

The cdi_ipcress package is part of cdi.  It provides an interface to the IPCRESS
opacities library.

\b History:

- Created in 2011 by Kelly Thompson
- Software is based on code found in xRage to meet platform requirements for
  CCS-2 TRT software (i.e.: non-LANL HPC machines like Mac, Windows, and Linux
  desktops; or alternate compilers like clang; and to support special nodes on
  Darwin like ARM, Power8/9, and KNL).  Fontes is under the impression that he
  gave the source code to me, but I don’t think I have ever had access to
  <a
  href="https://xweb.lanl.gov/projects/data/atomic/gandolf/gandolf.php">XCP-5's
  ‘gandolf’</a> library sources
- Designated open source software (BSD-3 License) in 2016
  (github.com/lanl/draco). LA-CC-16-016 (Draco-6) and C19028 (Draco-7).
- Current implementation is 1400 lines of C++ (only 1100 lines if you ignore the
  special ODFMG extensions -- this is no longer used AFAIK).
- Reads data from binary files and serves up these data arrays to clients.  It
  does no post-processing or shaping of the data.
- In 2014, Alex Long created a python based GUI opacity plotter that complements
  the core features of the cdi_ipcress package.  This 400 lines of python code
  is stored alongside the IPCRESS reader source code.
- Draco’s IPCRESS reader has been essentially zero-cost wrt to maintenance costs
  since its implementation in 2011.  We have made recent improvements related as
  identified by compiler sanitizer and lint tools -- but this work was done
  along with all of the other code in Draco and not as specific support of the
  IPCRESS reader.
- Because of its easy-to-use C/C++ interface and portability, the Draco IPCRESS
  reader has been used successfully by many other projects at LANL, including
  Chicoma, NGC (HKPark’s work with Symphony), and several summer student and
  postdoc projects.
