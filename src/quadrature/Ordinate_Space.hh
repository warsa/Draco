 * \class Ordinate_Space
 * \brief Describes a choice of discrete ordinate and truncated moment
 *        representations of ordinate space.
 *
 * This class encapsulates descriptions of a discrete ordinate space and a
 * truncated moment space and provides representations of a set of operators
 * operating on these spaces. The moment space is diagonal in any scattering
 * operator for an isotropic material and thus is preferred for coupling to the
 * physics.
 *
 * The discrete ordinate space is described by the methods and data inherited
 * from Ordinate_Set. The heart of this description is the vector<Ordinate>
 * returned by the Ordinate_Set::ordinates method.
 *
 * The moment space is described by the moment to discrete transformation matrix
 * returned by Ordinate_Space::M() and the discrete to moment transformation
 * matrix returned by Ordinate_Space::D(). The moment rank of these matrices is
 * returned by Ordinate_Space::number_of_ordinates while the ordinate rank is
 * given by Ordinate_Set::ordinates().size(). The number of moments of each
 * order in the moment space is returned as a vector<unsigned> by
 * Ordinate_Space::moments_per_order(), and so the size of
 * Ordinate_Space::moments_per_order() is one more than the moment expansion
 * order. The actual L and M of the spherical harmonic corresponding to each
 * moment is returned by Ordinate_Space::moments().
 *
 * There is a subtlety here: Ordinate_Space::moments.size() is greater than
 * Ordinate_Space::number_of_moments() because the former may contain additional
 * moments, of higher order than the specified expansion order, used to
 * construct the M and D matrices but not included in the actual scattering
 * expansion. See Galerkin_Ordinate_Space for an example where this is done with
 * an explanation of why it is useful.
 *
 * The actual spherical harmonic basis used for the moment space is given by
 * rtt_sf::Ylm, which is a real representation in which m=0 is the axially
 * symmetric moment, m<0 are the moments even in phi, and m>0 are the moments
 * odd in phi. For 1-D not axisymmetric, we do the obvious thing and choose to
 * align the polar axis with the coordinate axis. However, for all other
 * geometries, we assign mu = cos(theta)*cos(phi) to the first coordinate axis
 * and xi=sin(theta) to the second coordinate axis. This may seem a strange
 * choice, but it simplifies the representation of symmetries in reduced
 * geometry, particularly for Galerkin_Ordinate_Space.
 *
 * The mu, eta, and xi reflection maps give, for each ordinate i, the index of
 * the ordinate that is the reflection of i in the specified coordinate
 * plane. Thus, on a reflection plane reflecting the first coordinate, the
 * specific intensity of ordinate i is reflected into the specific intensity of
 * ordinate reflec_mu[i]. This greatly simplifies implementing reflection
 * boundary conditions.
 *
 * In curvilinear geometry, the streaming operator includes a nontrivial angle
 * derivative ithat introduces dependencies between ordinates. We assume that an
 * angle derivative can be cast in block bidiagonal form, so that there is not
 * more than one direct dependency per ordinate. The Ordinate_Space may then
 * order the ordinates by dependency, so the first ordinate can have no
 * dependencies, the second may be directly dependent only on the first, and so
 * on. Thus a client need only check whether an ordinate is dependent on the
 * preceeding angle or not.
 *
 * Each of the blocks in the block bidiagonal form of the angle operator is
 * referred to as a "level." This is terminology held over from the particular
 * case of 2-D axisymmetric geometry, where the ordinate sets generally are
 * organized on "levels" having the same z direction cosine (xi) which are
 * coupled by the omega derivative term. It is useful to know the number of such
 * blocks to optimize storage of intermediate results.
 *
 * We illustrate with an example. In axisymmetric geometry, Morel's
 * discretization (J.E. Morel, "An R-Z Geometry Triangular-Mesh Sn Spatial
 * Differencing Scheme," Technical Memorandum CCS-4:03-14(U), May 12, 2003.) of
 * the angle derivative term in the streaming operator is
 *
 * \f$\frac{\partial (\eta \psi)}{\partial \omega}\approx
 * \frac{1}{w_m}(\alpha_{m+1/2}\psi_{m+1/2}-\alpha_{m-1/2}\psi_{m-1/2})\f$
 *
 * where
 *
 * \f$\psi_{m+1/2} = \frac{1}{\tau_m}(\psi_m-(1-\tau_m)\psi_{m-1/2})\f$
 *
 * Thus we define
 *
 * <code>Psi_Coefficient(m)</code> = \f$P_m =
 * \frac{\alpha_{m+1/2}}{w_m\tau_m}\f$
 *
 * <code>Source_Coefficient(m)</code> =
 \f$S_m = \frac{\alpha_{m+1/2}\frac{1-\tau_m}{\tau_m}+\alpha_{m-1/2}}{w_m}\f$
 *
 * <code>Bookkeeping_Coefficient(m)</code> = \f$B_m = \frac{1}{\tau_m}\f$
 *
 * The angle derivative can then be coded as
 *
 * \f$\frac{\partial (\eta \psi)}{\partial \omega} =
 * P_m\psi_m-S_m\psi_{m-1/2}\f$
 *
 * and the next midpoint intensity as
 *
 * \f$\psi_{m+1/2} = B_m\psi_m-(1-B_m)\psi_{m-1/2})\f$
 *
 * Similar expressions can be written for spherical geometry. The Ordinate_Space
 * interface hides these details, presenting only the \f$P_m\f$, \f$S_m\f$, and
 * \f$B_m\f$ coefficients required for actual computation.
 *
 * Note that this discretization of the angle derivative terms must still be
 * substituted into the transport equation, which is then further discretized in
 * space. Thus the angle derivative term will generally be multiplied by an
 * additional factor arising from the spatial discretization.
