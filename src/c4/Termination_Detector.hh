 * \class Termination_Detector
 * \brief Detect termination of an indeterminate parallel algorithm.
 *
 * This class is our implementation in C++ of Will McLendon's (Sandia)
 * termination package.  It is used to detect termination of an indeterminate
 * algorithm.
 *
 * An indeterminate algorithm is one for which it is not possible to determine
 * in advance how much work must be done on each processor.  One example of an
 * indeterminate algorithm is traversal of a directed graph that may have
 * cycles. A processor performing such a sweep cannot know in advance whether
 * all of its nodes will be visited by the traversal, which makes the
 * traversal indeterminate.
 *
 * The code is used as follows: Every time a processor is able to make
 * progress on the computation (as measured in arbitrary units of work) the
 * Update_Work_Count function should be called to indicate the progress
 * made. Whenever data is communicated to another processor, the
 * Update_Send_Count function should be called to indicate the messages sent
 * out. And whenever data is received, the Update_Receive_Count function
 * should be called to indicate the messages received.
 *
 * Whenever a processor has no more work to do, it should be sure the counts
 * are all updated, then call Process() to see if the algorithm has
 * terminated. Termination occurs when no processor has work to do (as implied
 * by the call to Process()), no processor has done any work since the last
 * check, and all sent messages have been received.
 *
 * See test/tstTermination_Detector for an example of how this works.
