/*! Add the specified character to the buffer.
 *
 * For simplicity, opstream is currently implemented by treating every
 * character write as an overflow which is intercepted and added to the
 * internal buffer. This is not actually that inefficient for this class,
 * since it means that when the stream using the buffer wants to insert
 * data, it checks the buffer's cursor pointer, always finds that it is null,
 * and and calls overlow intead. These are not expensive operations. Should
 * we see any evidene this class is taking significant time, which should not
 * happen for its intended use (synchronizing diagnostic output), we can
 * reimplement to let the stream do explicitly buffered insertions without
 * this change affecting any user code -- this interface is all private.
 *
 * \param c Next character to add to the internal buffer.
 *
 * \return Integer representation of the character just added to the buffer.

/*! Shrink the buffer to fit the current data.
 *
 * This is included for completeness, and also to let a user who is really
 * concerned about the last byte of storage shrink the buffer of an opstream
 * that has done some large writes, and which he will be using again later,
 * but which he does not want tying up any memory in the meanwhile.
