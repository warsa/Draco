 * \fn inline double taylor_series_planck(double x)
 * \brief Computes the normalized Planck integral via a 21 term Taylor
 * expansion.
 *
 * The taylor expansion of the planckian integral looks as follows:
 * \code
 * I(x) = c0 ( c3 x^3 + c4 x^4 + c5 x^5 + c7 x^7 + c9 x^9 + c11 x^11 + c13 x^13 +
 *           c15 x^15 + c17 x^17 + c19 x^19 + c21 x^21 )
 * \endcode
 * If done naively, this requires 136 multiplications. If you accumulate
 * the powers of \f$ x \f$ as you go, it can be done with 24 multiplications.
 *
 * If you express the polynomaial as follows:
 * \code
 * I(x) = c0 x^3 ( c3 + x ( c4 + x (c5 + x^2 ( c7 + x^2 ( c9 + x^2 ( c11 + x^2
 * ( c13 + x^2 ( c15 + x^2 ( c17 + x^2 ( c19 + x^2 c21 ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) )
 * \endcode
 * the evaluation can be done with 13 multiplications. Furthermore, we do not
 * need to worry about overflow on large powers of \f$ x \f$, since the
 * largest power we compute is \f$ x^3 \f$.
 *
 * \param  The point at which the Planck integral is evaluated.
 * \return The integral value.

 * \class CDI
 *
 * \brief This class provides a Common Data Interface (CDI) to Atomic,
 * Nuclear and Equation of State (EOS) data.
 *
 * \sa The Draco packages cdi_gandolf (opacity data) and cdi_eospac (equation
 * of state data).
 *
 * The client must first instantiate concrete Opacity, Nuclear and EOS classes
 * that are derived from the abstract classes found in the CDI package.  A CDI
 * object is then created using these concrete classes as constructor
 * parameters.  Each CDI object will provide access to data for
 * <b><i>one</i></b> material.  This material may be a mixture (e.g. water) if
 * that mixture has been defined in the underlying data tables.  However, CDI
 * will not mix data table entries to create a new material.  This type of
 * mixing should be done by a seperate package or the client code.
 *
 * Since this header file does not include the definitions for GrayOpacity or
 * MultigroupOpacity, the calling routine must include these header files.  If
 * the calling routine does not make use of one of these classes then it's
 * definition file does not need to be included, however this will result in
 * the compile-time warning:
 *
 * <pre>
 *       line 69: warning: delete of pointer to incomplete class
 *          delete p;
 * </pre>
 *
 * The user should not worry about this warning as long he/she is not trying
 * to instantiate the class specified by the error message.
 *
 * Including CDI.hh in the client file will automatically include all of the
 * pertinent cdi headers and definitions (rtt_cdi::GrayOpacity,
 * rtt_cdi::MultigroupOpacity, EoS, rtt_cdi::Model, rtt_cdi::Reaction).
 *
 * CDI also contains static services that allow a client to integrate the
 * (normalized) Planckian and Rosseland (\f$ \partial B/\partial T \f$)
 * integrals.  The overloaded functions that perform these services are:
 *
 * \arg integratePlanckSpectrum(double const lowFreq, double const highFreq,
 * double const T)
 *
 * \arg integratePlanckSpectrum(double const freq, double const T)
 *
 * \arg integrateRosselandSpectrum(double const lowf, double const hif,
 * double T);
 *
 * \arg integrate_Rosseland_Planckian_Spectrum(double const lowf, const
 * double hif, double const T, double& PL, double& ROSL);
 *
 * \arg integratePlanckSpectrum(int const groupIndex, double const T);
 *
 * \arg integratePlanckSpectrum(double const T);
 *
 * \arg integrateRosselandSpectrum(int const groupIndex,  double const T);
 *
 * \arg integrate_Rosseland_Planckian_Spectrum(int const groupIndex, const
 * double T, double& PL, double& ROSL);
 *
 * The first four forms can be called (CDI::integratePlanckSpectrum())
 * anytime.  They simply integrate the normalized Planckian or Rosseland over
 * a frequency range.  The next four forms may only be called after the
 * multigroup frequency boundaries have been set.  These boundaries are set
 * after a call, from any CDI object, to setMultigroupOpacity().  The
 * frequency boundaries are stored statically.  After an initial call by any
 * CDI object of setMultigroupOpacity(), the frequency bounds are checked to
 * make sure they do not change.  Changing the boundaries throws an exception.
 * Thus, clients are allowed to view the group structure through any
 * multigroup data set (cdi.mg()->getGroupBoundaries()) or "globally" by
 * calling CDI::getFrequencyGroupBoundaries().  The context of usage dictates
 * which type of call to make; the result is invariant.  See the test
 * (tCDI.cc) for usage examples of the CDI Plankian and Rosseland integration
 * routines.
 *
 * We detail the two types of integration here, instead of in the individual
 * methods:
 *
 * The Planckian functions integrate the normalized Plankian that is defined:
 *
 * \f[
 *    b(x) = \frac{15}{\pi^4} \frac{x^3}{e^x - 1}
 * \f]
 *
 * where
 *
 * \f[
 *    x = \frac{h\nu}{kT}
 * \f]
 *
 * and
 *
 * \f[
 *    B(\nu,T)d\nu = \frac{acT^4}{4\pi} b(x)dx
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$B(\nu,T)\f$ is the Plankian and is defined
 *
 * \f[
 *    B(\nu,T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{h\nu/kt} - 1}
 * \f]
 *
 * The normalized Plankian, integrated from 0 to \f$\infty\f$, equals
 * one. However, depending upon the maximum and minimum group boundaries, the
 * normalized Planck function may integrate to something less than one.
 *
 * This function performs the following integration:
 *\f[
 *      \int_{x_{low}}^{x_{high}} b(x) dx
 *\f]
 * where \f$x_{low}\f$ is calculated from the input low frequency bound and
 * \f$x_high\f$ is calculated from the input high frequency bound.  This
 * integration uses the method of B. Clark (JCP (70)/2, 1987).  We use a
 * 10-term Polylogarithmic expansion for the normalized Planckian, except in
 * the low-x limit, where we use a 21-term Taylor series expansion.
 *
 * The user is responsible for applying the appropriate constants to the
 * result of this integration.  For example, to make the result of this
 * integration equivalent to
 * \f[
 *      \int_{\nu_{low}}^{\nu_{high}} B(\nu,T) d\nu
 * \f]
 * then you must multiply by a factor of \f$\frac{acT^4}{4\pi}\f$ where a is
 * the radiation constant.  If you want to evaluate expressions like the
 * following:
 *\f[
 *      \int_{4\pi} \int_{\nu_{low}}^{\nu_{high}} B(\nu,T) d\nu d\Omega
 *\f]
 * then you must multiply by \f$acT^4\f$.
 *
 * In the limit of \f$T \rightarrow 0, b(T) \rightarrow 0\f$, therefore we
 * return a hard zero for a temperature equal to a hard zero.
 *
 * The integral is calculated using a polylogarithmic series approximation,
 * except for low frequencies, where the Taylor series approximation is more
 * accurate.  Each of the Taylor and polylogarithmic approximation has a
 * positive trucation error, so they intersect above the correct solution;
 * therefore, we always use the smaller one for a continuous concatenated
 * function.  When both frequency bounds reside above the Planckian peak
 * (above 2.822 T), we skip the Taylor series calculations and use the
 * polylogarithmic series minus one (the minus one is for roundoff control).
 *
 * This Rosseland functions integrate the normalized Rosseland that is defined:
 * \f[
 *    r(x) = \frac{15}{4\pi^4} \frac{x^4 e^x}{(e^x - 1)^2}
 * \f]
 * where
 * \f[
 *    x = \frac{h\nu}{kT}
 * \f]
 * and
 * \f[
 *    R(\nu, T)d\nu = \frac{4 acT^3}{4\pi}r(x)dx
 * \f]
 * where \f$R(\nu, T)\f$ is the Rosseland and is defined
 * \f[
 *    R(\nu, T) = \frac{\partial B(\nu, T)}{\partial T}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 *    B(\nu, T) = \frac{2h\nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{e^{\frac{h\nu}{kT}} - 1}
 * \f]
 * The normalized Rosseland, integrated from 0 to \f$\infty\f$, equals
 * one. However, depending upon the maximum and minimum group boundaries, the
 * normalized Rosseland function may integrate to something less than one.
 *
 * This function performs the following integration:
 * \f[
 *      \int_{x_1}^{x_N} r(x) dx
 * \f]
 * where \f$x_1\f$ is the low frequency bound and \f$x_N\f$ is the high
 * frequency bound of the multigroup data set.  This integration uses the
 * method of B. Clark (JCP (70)/2, 1987).  We use a 10-term Polylogarithmic
 * expansion for the normalized Planckian, except in the low-x limit, where
 * we use a 21-term Taylor series expansion.
 *
 * For the Rosseland we can relate the group interval integration to the
 * Planckian group interval integration, by equation 27 in B. Clark paper.
 * \f[
 *     \int_{x_1}^{x_N} r(x) dx = \int_{x_1}^{x_N} b(x) dx
 *     - \frac{15}{4\pi^4} \frac{x^4}{e^x - 1}
 * \f]
 * Therefore our Rosslenad group integration function can simply wrap the
 * Planckian function integratePlanckSpectrum(lowFreq, highFreq, T)
 *
 * The user is responsible for applying the appropriate constants to the
 * result of this integration.  For example, to make the result of this
 * integration equivalent to
 * \f[
 *      \int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_N} R(\nu,T) d\nu
 * \f]
 * then you must multiply by a factor of \f$\frac{4 acT^3}{4\pi}\f$ where a is
 * the radiation constant.  If you want to evaluate expressions like the
 * following:
 *\f[
 *      \int_{4\pi} \int_{\nu_1}^{\nu_N} B(\nu,T) d\nu d\Omega
 *\f]
 * then you must multiply by \f$ 4 acT^3 \f$.
 *
 * In the limit of \f$ T \rightarrow 0, r(T) \rightarrow 0\f$, therefore we
 * return a hard zero for a temperature equal to a hard zero.
 *
