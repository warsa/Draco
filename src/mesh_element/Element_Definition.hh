 * \class Element_Definition
 *
 * \brief Provides some descriptive information on the standard mesh
 *        elements used in the RTT meshReader class.
 *
 * A few high points, trying not to wax eloquent. It was originally desired to
 * create a simple class that would concisely, unambiguously, and completely
 * describe any mesh element that could be conceived. While this may be a
 * laudable goal, it appears to be harder than it appears. Perhaps we could
 * get some help on this from some computational geometry experts at some
 * time. In the mean time here is my 80% solution.
 *
 * First, we will reduce the scope from any element to just the elements
 * currently supported by the <a href="http://www.cgns.org/"> CGNS </a> data
 * storage system. CGNS is an emerging industry standard for the storage and
 * retrival of computational physics data. Remember that it is only necessary
 * to describe the problem "geometry" with these elements, not the solution,
 * or any other field on the mesh, so this may not be as much of a restriction
 * as it first appears. The CGNS set consists of 18 elements including most of
 * the commonly used ones. Moreover, remember we currently have no means of
 * generating a mesh with weird custom elements. Any mesh anyone in the group
 * has ever run on can be expressed with just six of the 18 CGNS elements.
 *
 * Second, we will not try to design a completely general element description,
 * but will settle for providing a limited set of services that can be used to
 * discover a lot of things about the elements in the CGNS sub-set, but may
 * not necessarily be a universal, complete, and unambiguous description. The
 * ultimate authority on the element descriptions are the <a
 * href="http://www.CGNS.org/documents/Elements.pdf"> figures </a> and text
 * found in the CGNS SIDS-Additions manual.
 *
 * The description implemented herein utilizes a hierarchical approach. 3D
 * elements are described as assemblies of 2D elements, which are composed of
 * 1D elements, which are themselves composed of nodes. For example, a 3D
 * hexahedra is described in terms of its 2D quadrilateral faces, which are
 * described in terms of 1D line edge elements, which are then described in
 * terms of their constituent nodes.  This approach appears to be adequate for
 * the subset of elements under consideration herein, but it is not clear that
 * this will suffice in the general case.
 *
 * Utilities are provided to inquired about the type of a face (i.e. quad,
 * triangle, etc....) as well as the nodes that compose the face.
 *
 * In addition to face types, there is a concept of "node-location" within the
 * element. All nodes are given a location (i.e. "CORNER", "EDGE", etc....) to
 * aide in the description of the element. Again this appears to be adequate
 * for the sub-set of elements under consideration herein but may not be
 * adequate in a more general case.
 *
 * It is hoped that the node-location, together with the data available
 * through recursively descending through element faces, edges, and nodes
 * provides an adequate amount of information for our present needs. However,
 * it is difficult to show that this description is complete and unambiguous.
 *
 * \sa The \ref rtt_meshreaders_overview page provides an overview of
 * the other utilities in the rtt_mesh_element namespace.
 *
 * \todo KGB: The sizing information (\c dimension, \c number_of_nodes,
 * \c number_of_sides) really ought to be unsigned ints.  This automatically
 * enforces important invariants and makes it simpler to express preconditions
 * and postconditions. (2010-08-05 KT -- done)

     * \brief Describes the location of a node within an element.
     *
     * For the purposes of this enumeration, the terms have the following
     * meaning: A "corner" node terminates one or more edges of an element.
     * The term "edge" describes a node that lies on the interior of a 1D
     * element. The term "face" describes a node that lies on the interior of
     * a 2D element. Finally the term "cell" connotates a node that lies on
     * the interior of a 3D element.
     *
     * All elements will always have corner nodes. In addition, all elements
     * may have edge nodes. Two and three dimensional elements may also have
     * face nodes, and finally, three-dimensional elements may have cell
     * nodes. Under these definitions, note that a node's location is
     * unchanged in an element and all its sub-elements. i.e. the corner nodes
     * of a quadrilateral are also corner nodes in the line elements which
     * form the edges of the quadrilateral.
