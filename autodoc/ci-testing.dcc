\page ci_testing Setup CI Testing on GitHub.

Draco is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/lanl/Draco.

\par Travis testing

New pull requests should be on development branches and the request is to merge
each branch back to the 'develop' branch.  When a pull request is generated, we
want Travis (https://travis-ci.org) to run a basic build test.

You must have an account with travis-ci.org and register the Draco project with
travis-ci.org so that a web hook is installed.  The web hook runs the code
provided by ~/.travis.yml.

It is desireable for the travis script to run (1) a code style check (this uses
clang-format), (2) a build check using cmake and g++ and (3) a code coverage
report (see next paragraph).

\par Code Coverage

Track code coverage

\par AppVeyor

Run basic build test with the Visual Studio compiler.
