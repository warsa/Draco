Draco
----------------

Draco is an object-oriented component library geared towards
numerically intensive, radiation (particle) transport applications
built for parallel computing hardware.  It consists of
semi-independent packages and a robust build system.  The packages in
draco provide a set of components that can be used by multiple clients
to build transport codes.  The build system can also be extracted for
use in clients.

To clone draco:

    $ git clone https://github.com/losalamos/Draco.git

Compiling
----------------

Prerequisites:

* [cmake-3.5 or later](https://cmake.org/download/)
* A modern C++ compiler (g++, icpc, pgCC, clang++, cl)
** `CXX`, `CC` and 'FC` must be set in your environment and point to the C++, C and Fortran compilers that you wish to use.
* MPI (openMPI, mpich)
** `mpiexec` must be found in your PATH
* [Random123](https://www.deshawresearch.com/downloads/download_random123.cgi)
** The environment variable `RANDOM123_INC_DIR` must be set to the include directory for Random123.
* [Gnu Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
** `gsl-config` must be found in your PATH
* python 2X

Only needed for testing:
* [numdiff](https://www.nongnu.org/numdiff)

Configure:
* Use a separate build directory

    $ cmake ../Draco.git
```

Build:
```
   $ make
```
Test:
```
   $ ctest
```
Install:
```
   $ make install
```
